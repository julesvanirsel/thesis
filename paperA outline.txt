auroral system science: current closure flux tube morphology

Intro:
	- Yano/Ebihara 2021(3d current closure)
	- Fujii 2011/2012 (2.5 d cowling channel)
	- Amm. 2008 (3d high lat ionosphere)
	- Richmond 2010? poynting flux stuff? specific to sheetlike arcs
	- marghitu 2012 a (3d discrete auroral models)
		- 4th and super fancy continuitation
	- Newell 2001 (ionosphere impacts space weather because conductivity)
	- Kaeppler 2012 (high and low alt div E and curl B rocket measurements)
	- st maurice ( energy budgets)
	- 


question: what are the dominant control factors that govern the path current flux tubes take to close in auroral systems?
	- minimization of
		- J.E?
		- sigma/SIGMA?
		- are they the same?
	- but *******
		- path of closure is known (up to gemini errors) for given set of 2 from {E,j,sigma(E0,Q)}
		- we answer what path does system choose depending on what triplet is used
	- 

methods:
	- why flux tubes?
		- divJ=0 allows for it
		- Intuitive answer to "how does a region of current close"
		- Can see where current of region A closes to region B and how the morphology changes
		- hasn't been done before

results:
	- distance from FAC inflection point versus
		- squeezing parameter (200 by 20 km region goes to 300 by 13 km region when 50 km sout of inflection)
		- closing altitude range
		- closing angle
		- eastward centroid change
	- precipitation energy versus
		- closing altitude range
		- closing angle
		- eastward centroid change
	- bend paramaters? maybe stick with straight arcs in this paper?
	- flow driven versus FAC driven
	- I'd like to try a multipolar current sheet/play with sheet width
		- do 2 pairs of say 2x100 km wide sheets with
			- one having two identical precip patterns
			- one giving the current closure a choice between two different precips
	- can also do | p |  r   | P | instead of | r | p | r | P |

conclusions:
	- current flux tubes choose the path of least resistance
	- current flux tubes choose the path of least joule heating
	- *** tweak (v,j,sigma), path is known, what triplet works
