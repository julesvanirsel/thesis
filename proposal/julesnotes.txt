slide 5:  "can see ... currents", how do we see that?

magnetosphere has currents fron distortion

**streamline

sl6:  add an image?  use your cartoon up front

sl7:  add an image (add icon of cartoon)

sl8:  kelley/brekke ref
add jpar(x,y) for 2d map ref;  add an image, perhaps a contour output plot

sl9:  we're >> were

sl10:  why is fujii 3d?

sl11: verbal ref to kaeppler hall thought? "as we discussed
using gemini for isinglass and arcs, the idea of hall/ dissipationletss became intereting"

***before thesis statement, need some more about open questions, 
how ionosphere chooses, wht is meant by "self consistent" solution, "reading the aurora"

(3:02) thesis statement

sl16: don't say "the potential of .." 

sl17:  refs for gemini?  or on earlier slide?

sl19:  adjust for drive 2, solve one two ways

sl21:  show examples of driving maps

(3:07)

sl22:  replicate cite clayton2019
show two different cases (drive wtih flow, find j, and vv)

sl23:  decide what to say, introduce the 4panel maps

sl24: clayton19 ref not 21
--glow, show example different spectra and why might matter
--write out SEA

sl27:  add background color for strength of j?  anything to indicate relative dominance of which currents
--introduce the idea of a vertical cut of the model space, and
of the output data
--need to have some cuts before this new plot

sl28: with movie say explicitly connects out into along-arc direciton

sl29: don't say "current";  do say "Alfvenic" in first bullet

(3:16)

sl32: not enough pictures, don't do all in words

sl33: spend more time here, walk through axes

sl39,40:  talk more re current artifacts (blow up);
filamentary currecnt from an along-arc driver

various:  add figure headings to different run examples

sl43: note sharc seen at poker (show?);  does sharc include full current sheet**distinguish

sl46:  cross-ref to ted/picket

sl48:  careful with dismissive "anyways"
--refer back to alex study (flow chart?)

sl49:  why "suppression" step?

sl52:
(3:26)

**need some closure to science plan before movign to schedule/tasks
**after sl50, need some bridege/closure, why all cool, reading 
the aurora, exciteing.

sl53:  can't see purple text;  and, fix link
--decide what to say, ***streaminline


slide 58:  studies >> studied

sl59:  AFU
--will aim to pass >> will complete

sl60:  other groups?

sl61:  better ending
